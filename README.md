### Basic Functionality

When application opens, user can click on plus icon at the bottom to open camera. Once camera is opened, user can click on the circular button at the bottom to capture an image. By default, user can only use back camera. After the picture has been captured, user is taken to an editing screen. On this screen, user can draw on the image using different colors, stroke thickness and stroke style. Once the user is done, the image can be saved using the save button. These pictures can be deleted by long hold on image thumbnail on main screen. The application can also recieve notifications from Firebase in a Service. Application also runs location in a background service.
